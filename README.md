## About Me

I am currently a **final-year Mechanical Engineering student** with a specialization in **Control Systems** at **VSB - Technical University of Ostrava**. I have a strong background in mechanical design, **automation engineering**, and **control systems**, paired with hands-on experience in manufacturing processes and **PLC programming**.

I also work as a **Mainframe Middleware Developer** at **Kyndryl Client Center** in Brno, where I focus on developing **Python-based solutions** for processing outputs of logging software, optimizing **CICS channel latency**, and visualizing log files. My academic and professional experiences have provided me with solid expertise in both hardware and software aspects of **manufacturing engineering**.

In addition, I am passionate about **game development**, currently working on a new game titled **"Rimunated"** using **Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)**. I use tools like **Character Creator 4**, **iClone 8**, **Blender**, and **Substance Painter** to create and design characters and assets for my game.
